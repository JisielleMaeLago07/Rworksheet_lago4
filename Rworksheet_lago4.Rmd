 #c. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

# Yes, if the height is heigher then the  shoesize is greater.

#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
factor_data <- c(1,4,3)

n_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(n_order_data)

#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function.

#b. View the dataset. Write the code and its result.

install.packages("readxl")

library(readxl)
import_march_csv <- read_excel("import_march.csv.xlsx")
View(import_march_csv)
